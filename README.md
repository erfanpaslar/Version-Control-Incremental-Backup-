# Version-Control-Incremental-Backup

# Getting Started:

This project is the best way to make backup of our big project\
the way this project backup the files is incremental\
it means rather than copying our project multiple times and actually we made a little bit change and it is not more than 1kb\
but we copy our whole project that might be hundreds of kb s \
insted of that we can just backup the changes and even conpress the change to make the minimom size\


# IMPORTANT:
1. make sure your path starts with CAPITAL letter 😑😐 (for example: C:\Users\Username\Desktop\New folder) :) will be taking care of in next version 😊😅
2. your file name should "NOT" have SPACE in it 😁 (for examle: new file.txt or File name.py ...)
3. do not use these name for the file name 😂 (0 ,1 ,2 ,... ,9 ,a, b, c , ..., z, cab, ca, ab) WTF!
4. just use file names like: FileName.txt , File.c , Filename.py , ...
5. no numbers in the begining of any folder or file.😉


BUT IT RUNS 😎
